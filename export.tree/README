# BIDS Resting State fMRI Dataset

This dataset contains preprocessed resting state fMRI data collected from 2 subjects using a Siemens 3T MRI scanner. Each subject completed a single resting state scan lasting approximately 6 minutes.

## Subjects

- sub-17017
- sub-19738

## Scanning Parameters

- TR = 2.0 s
- TE = 30 ms
- Flip angle = 90 degrees
- 32-channel head coil
- Resolution = 3mm isotropic

## Preprocessing

The fMRI data were preprocessed using FSL (version 6.0.4) and included motion correction, slice-timing correction, spatial smoothing with a 6mm FWHM Gaussian kernel, and high-pass filtering with a cutoff of 0.01 Hz.

## Data Organization

The dataset is organized according to the BIDS specification (version 1.6.0), with each subject's data contained within a separate directory. The directory structure is as follows:
